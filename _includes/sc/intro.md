The Research Computing Group at ODU is pleased to offer a series of hands-on workshop this Spring
on the topics of UNIX shell, Python programming language, and intro to HPC!
These short workshops are targeted to those who are new to research computing.

We are splitting up the topics this semester into smaller, more digestible events.
You can attend one or more of the workshops depending on your need, interest, and
level of knowledge.
No prior computational experience is required.
The goal of this workshop series is to present a basic introduction to research computing
(with particular emphasis on ODU's Wahab cluster), job schedulers.
UNIX shell is an essential tool to interact with the HPC clusters.
Python is a highly popular programming language that has gained popularity
among researchers on HPC platforms.
We will use a hands-on format to teach fundamental skills for working effectively on HPC clusters.
Make sure you bring a laptop.

Here are the details of the five workshops along with some details to
help you how to choose the topics suitable to you:

1. **UNIX Shell I**:
   We will introduce the shell and work with files and directories with basic UNIX commands
   (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`, ...).
   Geared to those who have not used UNIX shell.

2. **UNIX Shell II**:
   We will discuss pipes, filters, loops, shell scripts, and finding things.
   This workshop assumes basic understanding of UNIX shell.
   Those who are unfamiliar with the shell are recommended to take "UNIX Shell" I as well.

3. **Python I**:
   We will cover Python fundamentals, processing and visualizing tabular data, loops, and lists.
   Geared to those who have never used Python.

4. **Python II**:
   We will analyze data from multiple files, create functions, and
   discuss errors, exceptions, debugging, and command-line programs. 
   Those who are unfamiliar with Python are recommended to take "Python I" as well.

5. **HPC Intro**:
   This workshop is intended to present a basic introduction to HPC
   (with particular emphasis on ODU's Wahab cluster).  It will provide
   an overview of the job scheduler and how to use tools available on
   Wahab.
   Working knowledge of UNIX shell is assumed.
